## How to Create a Test and Measurement Application with Measurement Studio 2019.01.49152?
 
To create a test and measurement application with Measurement Studio 2019.01.49152, you need to follow these steps:

1. Launch Microsoft Visual Studio and create a new project of your preferred type (Windows Forms Application, WPF Application, Console Application, etc.).
2. Add a reference to the Measurement Studio assemblies that you need for your application. For example, if you want to use engineering UI controls, you need to add a reference to NationalInstruments.UI.WindowsForms.dll or NationalInstruments.UI.Wpf.dll.
3. Add the engineering UI controls that you want to use to your form or window. You can find them in the Toolbox under Measurement Studio category.
4. Add code to initialize and configure your hardware device using the hardware class libraries. For example, if you want to use a DAQ device, you need to add a reference to NationalInstruments.DAQmx.dll and use the DaqSystem class to discover and create tasks for your device.
5. Add code to acquire data from your hardware device using the Read or ReadSingleSample methods of your task object.
6. Add code to analyze your data using the Professional Analysis or Enterprise Analysis class libraries. For example, if you want to perform a Fourier transform on your data, you need to add a reference to NationalInstruments.Analysis.Enterprise.dll and use the SpectralMeasurements class.
7. Add code to display your data using the engineering UI controls properties and methods. For example, if you want to plot your data on a waveform graph, you need to use the Plot method of the WaveformGraph object.
8. Build and run your application and test its functionality.

## Conclusion
 
Measurement Studio 2019.01.49152 is a powerful tool for building test and measurement applications in Microsoft Visual Studio using .NET languages. It provides engineering UI controls, hardware class libraries, TDMS file format support, analysis class libraries, and installer builder features
